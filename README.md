  <h1>Description:</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the Active Directory Domain Cntroller Deployment project! This GitHub repository provides comprehensive guidance for downloading the Windows Server 2019 ISO file, setting up an Active Directory Domain Controller (DC) within a virtual machine (VM), configuring user accounts, and automating the creation of additional Active Directory users using PowerShell scripts, and lastly setting up all the aspects of networking (DHCP, NICs, DNS, etc). Through this project, you'll learn how to establish a robust network infrastructure and manage user accounts efficiently using Active Directory.</p>

  <h1>Features:</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Active Directory Domain Controller Setup: </strong>Step-by-step instructions to configure a Windows Server 2019 VM as an Active Directory Domain Controller, including setting up two NICsâ€”one internal and one external for Wi-Fi.</li>
    <li><strong>Network Configuration: </strong>Configure networking settings to ensure that the Windows 10 Pro client is connected through the DC's internal NIC while receiving internet connectivity through the DC's external facing NIC.</li>
    <li><strong> PowerShell Script for User Creation: </strong>Utilize PowerShell scripts to automate the creation of 1,000 Active Directory users, enabling scalability and facilitating testing of Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and security Identity and Access Management (IAM) settings.</li>
